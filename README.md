# This repository explores mathematical concepts using Python.

## Titles of the Programs in this repository:

### 1. Astroid Plot – Plot and analyze the astroid curve defined by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = a^(2/3) using Python.

### 2. Cardioid Plot – Plot the cardioid curve defined by r=5+5cos(θ) using Python’s polar coordinates.

### 3. Cissiod Plot - Plot the cissoid curve defined by (y^2)*(a-x) = x^3 using Python.

### 4. Circle Plot using Polar coordinates - Plot equidistant points on a circle of radius 5 using polar coordinates in Python.
